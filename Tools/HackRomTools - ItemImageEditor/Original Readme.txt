This tool requires a bit of understanding, so I thought I'd do a ReadMe!

The purpose of this program is really for adding new items over blank spaces.

First of all, you need to get your indexed item sprite and burn the image and pallete to your ROM using unLZ.GBA into
a blank space. Remember the offsets you picked, then find the item that you want to change.

Click on it and the offsets for the image and pallete will be dispayed.

The default for a blank item is:

Image = E87028
Pallete = E870A0

Then, in the relevant boxes, type your new offsets and hit File,Save.

The data will be saved and your item will have a different image!

Warning: Do not put in characters that are not valid Hex characters as this will write over the next item's offset.
